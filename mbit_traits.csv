E2,"People with more extroverted tendencies are often the center of attention — and they like it that way. They thrive in social situations, and they seek out social stimulation. Extroverts often aren’t afraid to introduce themselves to new people, and they rarely avoid unfamiliar situations for fear of messing up or not knowing someone.","While introverts need to escape to their homes or offices after a night out with friends or an intense meeting, extroverts find that too much alone time drains their natural energy. They recharge their internal batteries by being around other people.","Extroverts feel comfortable in large groups. They may be more likely to spearhead group sports or group outings. They may be the ring leader for weekend activities, after-work cocktail hours, or other social events. They rarely turn down invitations to weddings, parties, and other gatherings.","Extroverts make new friends easily. This is in part because they enjoy other people’s energy and getting to engage with people around them. They also tend to have a large social network and many acquaintances. With pursuing new interests and activities, extroverts are often keen to expand their social circles.","While introverts are more likely to internalize problems and think through them, extroverts don’t mind taking their problems to others for discussion and guidance. They’re often more willing to express themselves openly and make clear their preferences or choices.","Extroverts are often described as happy, positive, cheerful, and sociable. They aren’t as likely to dwell on problems or ponder difficulties. While they experience difficulties and troubles like anyone else, extroverts are often more able to let it roll off their backs.","Extroverts may engage in risky behavior. Some theories assert that their brain is wired to reward them for it if it goes well. One studyTrusted Source found that extroverts who take risks and succeed are rewarded with dopamine, a chemical that triggers the reward center of the brain. In the case of the study, participants gambled, but the response could be true for any number of activities."

I2,"The idea of being home alone is thrilling, not taxing. These periods of solitude are crucial to an introvert’s health and happiness. Whether you’re simply spending time resting or engaging in an activity, solitude is a welcome relief. Introverts often enjoy reading, gardening, crafting, writing, gaming, watching movies, or doing any other activity that’s performed alone.","While extroverts would not dare miss a Friday night out with friends, introverts know when they’ve maxed out and need to refuel their batteries. That’s not to say all introverts will flake out of parties — they can and do enjoy them as much as any extrovert — but at the end of a long night, introverts need to escape to recharge and reset.","If a group project feels overwhelming or loathsome, you may be an introvert. Introverts often work best when they work alone. The isolation allows introverts to focus deeply and produce high-quality work. This isn’t to say introverts don’t work well with others; they just prefer to retreat and focus on the task at hand, rather than navigate the social aspect of working in a group setting.","Don’t mistake an introvert’s small circle of friends as a sign that they can’t make friends or don’t like to socialize. In fact, they enjoy talking with people and getting to know others. They also prefer the solitude of a small circle of friends. High-quality relationships are a key to happiness for introverts, according to one studyTrusted Source.",You may find yourself daydreaming or working things out in your mind long before you put a plan of action in place or lift a single finger to change anything. Introverts have a very active inner thought process. That also leads them toward self-reflection and research. Introverts are dedicated to pursuing their interests and feeling prepared and well-read.,"Introverts often “escape” from a situation by zoning out or letting their mind wander away from the task at hand. For you, this may be a way to leave a situation that feels too chaotic or uncomfortable; it’s a survival mechanism of sorts. But to others, it may seem like you’re unfocused.","You’re more comfortable writing out your thoughts rather than speaking, especially when you’re unprepared. You prefer to think through your response because your communication style is focused and considerate. You can carry on conversations, but if decisions are necessary, you may want more time to consider and weigh your options so you feel confident in the choice."
